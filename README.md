# BandaGo Plug-ins Project | ![TeamCity build status](https://teamcity.bandahealth.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:id:BHGO_Plugins_BuildDevelop/statusIcon.svg)
A repository that houses all Banda Health's plugins for iDempiere.

This resolves all BandaGo plugin dependencies and builds the deployment artifacts.
The included plugins are: 
* idemp-base
* idemp-base-editor
* idemp-webui
* idemp-rest

Additionally, the project also contains the data folders used during client creation. To leverage these files (located in the `data` directory) in your local instance, copy this directory to your `[IDEMPIERE_HOME]` directory.

## Building the Plugins
To build all BandaGo plugins, run:
```
mvn verify -Didempiere.home.dir=<absolute_path_to_idemp_repo/>
```
Example: 
`mvn verify -Didempiere.home.dir=/home/user1/idempiere/`

You can also configure your global settings so you don't have to provide the property each time. In your global settings file, set:
```
<settings ...>
  ...
  <profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>local-idempiere</id>
    <properties>
      <idempiere.home.dir>/home/user1/idempiere/</idempiere.home.dir>
    </properties>
  </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
```

## Running Tests
A database (DB) is needed to run tests (we test business logic, not implementation logic). You can either use your own and have test data be filled in it, or you can use a fresh DB. The Banda Health iDempiere image comes with data to initialize a new DB, if you'd like. Check the `.env.default` file for information that's available, plus the [Banda iDempiere Docker Image Repo](https://github.com/banda-health/idempiere-docker) for full image information.

Regardless of which DB you used, you will need an active `Gardwen World` client that comes with the base iDempiere DB & installation. The tests are run against this client and the SOAP webservices are configured as this client.

### Getting a separate, test DB
The [CI builds](https://teamcity.bandahealth.org/buildConfiguration/BHGO_IdempMigration_Build_BuildDevelop) output a DB file that has the scripts and 2-packs run on top of a base iDempiere DB. You can get this file, then restore it to a DB of your chooseing by running:
```
pg_restore -d [database_name] [db_file]
```
You can optionally add the user and hostname/port flags, if needed.

### Base Plugin & Report Testing
For the base plugin tests and for reports, you can run them
1. Through the UI or
2. Through Docker compose

#### In the UI
Log in as the Garden World client and search for `Populate` to see the screen appear. You can enter the number of loops and an optional package for your tests. This is based off [Chuck's testing framework](https://erp-academy.chuckboecking.com/?page_id=3711).

#### Through Docker Compose
Simply build the plugins and run `docker compose up` to run the tests. Any container that doesn't finish running in a healthy state had tests fail.

### Rest API Tests
These are run via Jest to connect to the server and test the endpoints. It is a TypeScript project that needs the types the API returns. These are automatically generated by building the `idemp-rest` plugin, so please do that first.

You can spin up the Docker container to run these tests, or you can run them on your machine if you provide the following environment variables for connecting:
* `IDEMPIERE_ENDPOINT`
* `IDEMPIERE_USER`
* `IDEMPIERE_USER_PASSWORD`

Then just run the tests via the Jest CLI.

#### In Development
There exists a `docker-compose.dev.yml` to allow easier running of the API tests while developing. This compose file spins up the container without running anything, then mounts the JS code to the container.

To leverage this,
1. Get iDempiere up and running (with a test or your regular DB).
2. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`.
3. After the container is running, attach to it via `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec idemp-rest-test /bin/bash`.
4. Execute `jest` to run the tests.

You can also adjust the test client used in the REST tests (since no hard-coding through a SOAP request is required) via the `.env` file.
